Course Description
------------------

This subject was originally offered in Course 13 (Department of Ocean Engineering) as 13.021. In 2005, ocean engineering became part of Course 2 (Department of Mechanical Engineering), and this subject was renumbered 2.20.

The fundamentals of fluid mechanics are developed in the context of naval architecture and ocean science and engineering. The various topics covered are: Transport theorem and conservation principles, Navier-Stokes' equation, dimensional analysis, ideal and potential flows, vorticity and Kelvin's theorem, hydrodynamic forces in potential flow, D'Alembert's paradox, added-mass, slender-body theory, viscous-fluid flow, laminar and turbulent boundary layers, model testing, scaling laws, application of potential theory to surface waves, energy transport, wave/body forces, linearized theory of lifting surfaces, and experimental project in the towing tank or propeller tunnel.

Course Prerequisites
--------------------

This course is traditionally taken by advanced undergraduate and first year graduate students in the Ocean Engineering Department. The typical capabilities of the students in the course is a very broad range due to its nature. However, a student should be very comfortable with calculus - in particular, vectors, integrals and derivatives. Complex math is not required however, some may be used during lecture. A previous fluids course is highly recommended.
